\subsection*{Introduction}

{\ttfamily htop} is a cross-\/platform interactive process viewer.

{\ttfamily htop} allows scrolling the list of processes vertically and horizontally to see their full command lines and related information like memory and C\+PU consumption. Also system wide information, like load average or swap usage, is shown.

The information displayed is configurable through a graphical setup and can be sorted and filtered interactively.

Tasks related to processes (e.\+g. killing and renicing) can be done without entering their P\+I\+Ds.

Running {\ttfamily htop} requires {\ttfamily ncurses} libraries, typically named libncurses(w).

{\ttfamily htop} is written in C.

\subsection*{Build instructions}

\subsubsection*{Prerequisite}

List of build-\/time dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item standard G\+NU autotools-\/based C toolchain
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C99 compliant compiler
\item {\ttfamily autoconf}
\item {\ttfamily automake}
\item {\ttfamily autotools}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily ncurses}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Note about {\ttfamily ncurses}\+:} \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily htop} requires {\ttfamily ncurses} 6.\+0. Be aware the appropriate package is sometimes still called libncurses5 (on Debian/\+Ubuntu). Also {\ttfamily ncurses} usually comes in two flavours\+: $>$$\ast$ With Unicode support. $>$$\ast$ Without Unicode support.

This is also something that is reflected in the package name on Debian/\+Ubuntu (via the additional \textquotesingle{}w\textquotesingle{} -\/ \textquotesingle{}w\textquotesingle{}ide character support). \end{quote}


List of additional build-\/time dependencies (based on feature flags)\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily sensors}
\item {\ttfamily hwloc}
\item {\ttfamily libcap} (v2.\+21 or later)
\item {\ttfamily libnl-\/3}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Install these and other required packages for C development from your package manager.

{\bfseries Debian/\+Ubuntu} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake build-essential
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Fedora/\+R\+H\+EL} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel automake autoconf gcc
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Archlinux/\+Manjaro} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo pacman -S ncurses automake autoconf gcc
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries mac\+OS} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
brew install ncurses automake autoconf gcc
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Compile from source\+:}

To compile from source, download from the Git repository ({\ttfamily git clone} or downloads from \href{https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/releases/}{\tt Git\+Hub releases}), then run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Install}

To install on the local system run {\ttfamily make install}. By default {\ttfamily make install} installs into {\ttfamily /usr/local}. To change this path use {\ttfamily ./configure -\/-\/prefix=/some/path}.

\subsubsection*{Build Options}

{\ttfamily htop} has several build-\/time options to enable/disable additional features.

\paragraph*{Generic}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/affinity}\+: enable {\ttfamily sched\+\_\+setaffinity(2)} and {\ttfamily sched\+\_\+getaffinity(2)} for affinity support; conflicts with hwloc
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item default\+: {\itshape check}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/hwloc}\+: enable hwloc support for C\+PU affinity; disables affinity support

\item dependency\+: {\itshape libhwloc}
\item default\+: {\itshape no}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/static}\+: build a static htop binary; hwloc and delay accounting are not supported
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item default\+: {\itshape no}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/debug}\+: Enable asserts and internal sanity checks; implies a performance penalty
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item default\+: {\itshape no}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Performance Co-\/\+Pilot}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/pcp}\+: enable Performance Co-\/\+Pilot support via a new pcp-\/htop utility
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dependency\+: {\itshape libpcp}
\item default\+: {\itshape no}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Linux}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/sensors}\+: enable libsensors(3) support for reading temperature data
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item dependencies\+: {\itshape libsensors-\/dev}(build-\/time), at runtime {\itshape libsensors} is loaded via {\ttfamily dlopen(3)} if available

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/capabilities}\+: enable Linux capabilities support
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/vserver}\+: enable V\+Server support
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Runtime dependencies\+:}

{\ttfamily htop} has a set of fixed minimum runtime dependencies, which is kept as minimal as possible\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily ncurses} libraries for terminal handling (wide character support).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Runtime optional dependencies\+:}

{\ttfamily htop} has a set of fixed optional dependencies, depending on build/configure option used\+:

\paragraph*{Linux}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily libdl}, if not building a static binary, is always required when support for optional dependencies (i.\+e. {\ttfamily libsensors}, {\ttfamily libsystemd}) is present.
\item {\ttfamily libcap}, user-\/space interfaces to P\+O\+S\+IX 1003.\+1e capabilities, is always required when {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/capabilities} was used to configure {\ttfamily htop}.
\item {\ttfamily libsensors}, readout of temperatures and C\+PU speeds, is optional even when {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/sensors} was used to configure {\ttfamily htop}.
\item {\ttfamily libsystemd} is optional when {\ttfamily -\/-\/enable-\/static} was not used to configure {\ttfamily htop}. If building statically and {\ttfamily libsystemd} is not found by {\ttfamily configure}, support for the systemd meter is disabled entirely.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\ttfamily htop} checks for the availability of the actual runtime libraries as {\ttfamily htop} runs.

\paragraph*{B\+SD}

On most B\+SD systems {\ttfamily kvm} is a requirement to read kernel information.

More information on required and optional dependencies can be found in \href{configure.ac}{\tt configure.\+ac}.
