This implementation utilizes kvm\+\_\+getprocs(3), sysctl(3), etc, eliminating the need for mount\+\_\+procfs(8) with Linux compatibility enabled.

The implementation was initially based on the Open\+B\+SD support in htop(1).

\subsection*{Notes on Net\+B\+SD curses }

Net\+B\+SD is one of the last operating systems to use and maintain its own implementation of Curses.

htop(1) can be compiled against either ncurses or Net\+B\+SD\textquotesingle{}s curses(3). In order for Net\+B\+SD\textquotesingle{}s libcurses to be used, htop(1) must be configured with {\ttfamily -\/-\/disable-\/unicode}. This is necessary because htop(1) with Unicode enabled directly accesses ncurses\textquotesingle{}s cchar\+\_\+t struct, which has different contents in Net\+B\+SD\textquotesingle{}s curses.

Versions of libcurses in Net\+B\+SD 9 and prior have no mouse support (this is an ncurses extension). Newer versions contain no-\/op mouse functions for compatibility with ncurses.

\subsection*{What needs improvement }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Kernel and userspace threads are not displayed or counted -\/ maybe look at Net\+B\+SD top(1).
\item Support for compiling using libcurses\textquotesingle{}s Unicode support.
\item Support for fstat(1) (view open files, like lsof(8) on Linux).
\item Support for ktrace(1) (like strace(1) on Linux).
